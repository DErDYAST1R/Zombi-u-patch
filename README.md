[Update 5/31/2025] To fix the issue with Animations & Ragdolls being super fast or bouncy/buggy you require to limit the game to 60FPS or Similar. I have not tested with anything higher then 60FPS as the WIIU & Development team used 60FPS when testing but you can try.

Limit game to 60FPS to fix Ragdolls & Animation Bugs.
