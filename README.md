# Zombi/U Patch for PC
This patch fixes (Sound, Crashes, Animations, Ragdolls, Graphics Optionally)

# Installation
` Drag and drop files from either 1.0 or 1.1 into your Main ZOMBI Folder, Replace files if needed `

# Ragdolls & Animations
**Limit the game to 60FPS or Near**, ZombiU Was never meant to run above 60FPS Which breaks ragdolls and animations. It is required to play the game at 60FPS or Near for best Ragdolls & Animations in game.

# Controllers
### XBOX
I am not to sure for XBOX Controllers if they work or not Plug & Play
### Playstation
For this you must use the tool DS4Windows and create a custom profile. You must swap buttons (X -> O , O -> X) and (SQUARE -> TRIANGLE , TRIANGLE -> SQUARE) while the output controller is on Dualshock 4.

You can download and install my custom DS4Windows profile and install it to either (C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\DS4Windows\Profiles) or wherever your DS4 Profiles folder is.
